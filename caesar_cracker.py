'''
This program can hack messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher from the previous project, even if you donâ€™t know the key. There are only 26 
possible keys for the Caesar cipher, so a computer can easily try all possible decryptions and display the results to the user. In cryptography, we call this technique a brute-force attack.

Report:

This Python script implements a brute force decryption method for text that has been encrypted using a Caesar cipher. A brute force method in the context of cryptography refers to an approach where an attacker systematically tries all possible keys to decrypt a ciphered text. In the case of a Caesar cipher, which shifts each letter in a message by a certain number of positions, the number of possible keys is equal to the number of letters in the alphabet - 26 for the English alphabet.

The main function of the script is brute_force_decrypt. This function takes in an encrypted message and a dictionary. The dictionary is used to validate whether the decrypted words are meaningful, as a successful decryption should result in a readable text.

The brute_force_decrypt function operates by iterating over all possible keys (0-25) and applying each one to the encrypted message. The decryption is done by the cypher function with the encryption flag set to False. For each key, the function counts how many words of the decrypted message are present in the provided dictionary. This is done by the check_word function. The key which results in the highest count (score) is considered to be the correct one, and the corresponding decrypted message is printed out.

The cypher function used within brute_force_decrypt is a simple implementation of a Caesar cipher that can both encrypt and decrypt messages. The check_word function is a helper function that checks the presence of a word in a given dictionary.
